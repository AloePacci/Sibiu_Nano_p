A TAM.yaml file will be stored in the config folder once you start a Gazebo world ::

roslaunch uuv_gazebo_worlds empty_underwater_world.launch

and then include the vehicle

roslaunch <ROBOT_NAME>_description upload.launch

and finally run

roslaunch <ROBOT_NAME>_control start_thruster_manager.launch reset_tam:=true

From now on, if you always start the thruster manager using the launch file above (using the reset_tam as false), you can load the TAM matrix.

To command the vehicle, you have to start the thruster manager and publish a ROS Wrench message to the input topic

/<ROBOT_NAME or ROBOT_NAMESPACE>/thruster_manager/input

with the wrench command to the vehicle. The thrust forces will be generated at each thruster's unit frame like in the RViz screenshot below.


roslaunch <ROBOT_NAME>_control start_thruster_manager.launch reset_tam:=true
